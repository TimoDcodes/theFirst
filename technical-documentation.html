        Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining
        websites for the internet. It involves a combination of programming
        languages, design skills, and technical knowledge to bring a website to
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web development encompasses several different areas, including front-end
        development, back-end development, and full-stack development. Front-end
        development focuses on creating the visual elements of a website that
        users see and interact with, such as layout, typography, and navigation.
        Back-end development involves building the server-side components of a
        website, such as databases and servers. Full-stack development involves
        working on both front-end and back-end development, creating a seamless
        user experience for the website's visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web development is an essential component of the digital world, powering
        everything from e-commerce sites to social media platforms. It requires
        a deep understanding of web technologies, programming languages, and
        user experience design, making it an exciting and constantly evolving
        field to be a part of.

      <header>Html Basics</header>
      <p>
        HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of
        every webpage on the internet. It is a markup language that is used to
        structure content on the web, allowing users to view and interact with
        web pages. HTML is an essential skill for any web developer, and it is
        easy to learn the basics. Here are two essential HTML concepts:
      </p>
      <li>
        Tags: HTML consists of a series of tags that are used to structure
        content on a web page. Tags are surrounded by angled brackets, and they
        usually come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and
        the closing tag following it. For example, to create a paragraph, we
        would use the tag, like this:
        <br />
      </li>
      <code>&ltp&gt This is a paragraph.&lt/p&gt </code>
      <li>
        Attributes: HTML tags can also have attributes, which provide additional
        information about the tag. Attributes are added to the opening tag and
        consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. For example,
        to add a link to a web page, we would use the &lta&gt tag, with the
        <bold>href</bold> attribute to specify the URL of the page we want to
        link to, like this:
      </li>
      <code
        >&lta&gt href="https://www.example.com"&gtThis is a link.&lt/a&gt
      </code>
      <br />
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Basics">
      <header>CSS Basics</header>
      <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe how HTML
        elements should be displayed on a webpage. By adding CSS to an HTML
        document, you can control the layout, color, font, and other visual
        aspects of the content.
        <br />
        One of the key concepts in CSS is the use of selectors to target
        specific HTML elements. Here's an example of a CSS rule that targets all
        paragraph elements on a webpage:
      </p>
      <code>
        p {<br />
        font-size: 16px;<br />
        color: #333;<br />
        line-height:1.5;<br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        This code sets the font size to 16 pixels, the text color to a dark gray
        (#333), and the line height to 1.5 times the font size for all paragraph
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important concept in CSS is the use of cascading and inheritance
        to apply styles to different elements. For example, you can define a
        style for a parent element and have it apply to all of its child
        elements as well. Here's an example of a CSS rule that targets a
        specific class:
      </p>
      <code
        >.highlight {<br />
        background-color: yellow;<br />
        color: black;<br />
        font-weight: bold;<br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        This code sets the background color to yellow, the text color to black,
        and the font weight to bold for all elements with the class "highlight".
        This class can then be applied to any HTML element on the page, such as
        a paragraph or heading, to make it stand out.
      </p>
      <li>
        CSS selectors can target elements by tag name, class, ID, or other
        attributes
      </li>
      <li>
        Cascading and inheritance allow styles to be applied to multiple
        elements at once
      </li>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Javascript_Basics">
      <header>Javascript Basics</header>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming
        language that is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web
        pages. It is a client-side scripting language that is embedded in HTML
        pages and runs in the browser. One of the fundamental features of
        JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM),
        which is the structure of the web page. With JavaScript, you can change
        the content, styles, and behavior of web pages in real-time. JavaScript
        is used to build a wide range of web applications, including games,
        animations, and dynamic forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the basic constructs in JavaScript is the function. Functions are
        blocks of code that can be called and executed multiple times, with
        different parameters. Here's an example of a simple JavaScript function
        that takes two parameters and returns their sum:
      </p>
      <code
        >function addNumbers(num1, num2) {<br />
        return num1 + num2;<br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        console.log(addNumbers(2, 3)); // outputs 5
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example, we define a function named addNumbers that takes two
        parameters num1 and num2. Inside the function, we use the return
        statement to return the sum of the two numbers. Finally, we call the
        function with the arguments 2 and 3 and print the result to the console
        using the console.log function. Functions are an essential part of
        JavaScript and are used extensively in programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of how to use a for loop to iterate over an array of
        numbers and print their values to the console:
      </p>
      <code
        >const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];<br />
        <br />
        for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {<br />
        console.log(numbers[i]);<br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example, we define an array of numbers and use a for loop to
        iterate over the array. The for loop has three parts: the
        initialization, the condition, and the increment. The initialization
        sets the loop variable i to 0, the condition checks if i is less than
        the length of the numbers array, and the increment increases i by 1
        after each iteration. Inside the loop, we print the value of each
        element in the array to the console using console.log. Loops are another
        fundamental construct in JavaScript and are used to repeat a block of
        code multiple times.
